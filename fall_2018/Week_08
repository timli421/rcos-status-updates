## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I tried to change the coding structures and pushed to the main branch. I got the RPI email address and personal 
information of my teammates, and I will post them on the website.

 ## This Week's Plan

 > This week I keep working on the website. Since it is almost Thanksgiving, I'll have much more free time to work on the project.
 Some of my teammates and me are going to meet during the break and work on the project together. One thing I need to 
 do is to push more files to the main brach.

 ## Anything Blocking?
> It is mid-term Exam week, I'm really really busy and not able to attend the small group discussion this week.
