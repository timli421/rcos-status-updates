## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week we had the presentation, and it went pretty well. Our VR team finished the presentation the week before us, and they finished all their jobs. During the last week I made some modifications in our problem report page, and besides that, I did not really have work to do. 

 ## This Week's Plan

> Upload my unfinished files to the github to show my progress during the past month.

 ## Anything Blocking?
> I really learned a lot of knowledge regarding HTML during the past month, and I also found some good HTML templates online(W3), they are free to use, and I just needed to build the website based on their templates. Thus, our front end team didn't need to spend the first few weeks learning HTML, and it would probably save us a lot more time.
