## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week we had the presentation, and it went pretty well. Our VR team finished the presentation the week before us, and they finished all their jobs. During the last week I made some modifications in our problem report page, and besides that, I did not really have work to do. 

 ## This Week's Plan

> Upload my unfinished files to the github to show my progress during the past month.

 ## Anything Blocking?
> No.
