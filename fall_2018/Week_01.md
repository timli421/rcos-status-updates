## Last Week's Accomplishments

 > Last week I learned HTML and JavaScript, those two languages were very important for us to build the website. Our front end team also set up the enviroment for the project. We downloaded the GitHub Desktop.


 ## This Week's Plan

 > This week we are going to build the basic structure of the website, and think about ways to design it.

 ## Anything Blocking?

 > At this stage we don't really need to ask for the help, since we are trying to learn the language and wait for the back end team and VR part.
