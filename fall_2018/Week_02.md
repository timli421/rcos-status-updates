## Last Week's Accomplishments

 > Last week I built the website with my team. However, I did not make much progress due to the exams.
 I added some title and learned how to "center" them. From HTML5, I learned the elements, styles and attributes.

 ## This Week's Plan

 > This week we are going to build the website and organize the code.

 ## Anything Blocking?

 > No. Since the exam week is over, I will have more time to work on the project.
