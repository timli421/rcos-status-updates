## Last Week's Accomplishments

> During the Thanksgiving break, we took some 3-D pictures in the union and added them to our github. I kept working on the introduction website and preparing for the upcoming presentation.

 ## This Week's Plan

 > This week I will finish the PPT, and keep working on the website.

 ## Anything Blocking?
> Our front end team already finished the intro website and other basic websites, so at this stage there is not much we can do.
