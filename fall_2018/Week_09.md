## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This is the last week of our Collegiate Store+ project, our front team already finished the websites we were working on. Last week I just changed some background pictures of the websites.
> RCOS provides us an amazing opportuniy to meet new friends and work on the project we are excited about. During the past weeks, I learned how to use HTML and JS, and I also built some my own webistes. This is my first time doing RCOS, and I have encountered some technical difficulties, but with the help of our great mentors and friends, I'm able to solve those problems.

 ## This Week's Plan

 > This week I will prepare for the presentation, and upload any unfinished files to the github.

 ## Anything Blocking?
> No.
