## Last Week's Accomplishments

 > Last week I haven't done much due to family visit, I added some background pictures, and made some minor changes in our problem report page.

 ## This Week's Plan

 > This week I'm going to work on the pictures, due to the technical issue, we need Samsung s8 phone or later version to succesfully operate the 3-D camera. None of our group member has Samsung, so we need to borrow one.

 ## Anything Blocking?

> No.
