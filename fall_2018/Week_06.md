## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I built an introduction website to introduce our project and team members. Also I modified the font size and 
background picture in the report.html.

 ## This Week's Plan

 > This week I will add some example pictures we took in the student union and team members' information on the website.

 ## Anything Blocking?
> At this stage my front end team couldn't really do much, since our websites are basically done, we still need the 3D pictures
from students union.
