## Last Week's Accomplishments

 > Last week I added images in the website. At this stage, I knew the basic features of HTML, I would make some changes to make the website look nicer.

 ## This Week's Plan

 > This friday, we will take 3D pictures in the union bookstore.

 ## Anything Blocking?

 > Yet, we do not know whether we are able to upload the 4D pictures to our website.
